# Flask Application with Docker, docker-compose, CI and CD with GitHub Actions

Created a directory in our local machine called python-docker and created a simple Python application using the Flask framework. We also used the requirements.txt file to gather our requirements, and created a Dockerfile containing the commands to build an image.
The Python application directory structure would now look like

```

python-docker
|____ app.py
|____ requirements.txt
|____ Dockerfile
```
